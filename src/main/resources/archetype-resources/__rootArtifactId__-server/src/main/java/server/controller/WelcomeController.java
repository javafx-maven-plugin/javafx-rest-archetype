 * SpringMVC Controller that lives on the server side and handles incoming HTTP requests. It is basically a servlet but
 * using the power of SpringMVC we can avoid a lot of the raw servlet and request/response mapping uglies that
 * servlets require and instead just deal with simple, clean Java Objects. For more information on SpringMVC see:

    /**
     * This method is exposed as a REST service. The @RequestMapping parameter tells Spring that when a request comes in
     * to the server at the sub-url of '/welcome' (e.g. http://localhost:8080/${parentArtifactId}-server/welcome)
     * it should be directed to this method.
     * <p/>
     * In normal SpringMVC you would typically handle the request, attach some data to the 'Model' and redirect to a
     * JSP for rendering. In our REST example however we want the result to be an XML response. Thanks to some Spring
     * magic we can just return our bean, annotate it with @ResponseBody and Spring will magically turn this into XML
     * for us.
     * <p/>
     * We really didn't need the whole WelcomeMessage object here and could just have easily returned a String. That
     * wouldn't have made a very good example though, so the WelcomeMessage is here to show how Spring turns objects
     * into XML and back again for easy REST calls. The 'date' parameter was added just to give it some spice.
     *
     * @param name the name of the person to say hello to. This is pulled from the input URL. In this case we use a
     *             request parameter (i.e. ?name=someone), but you could also map it directly into the URL if you
     *             prefer. See the very good SpringMVC documentation on this for more information.
